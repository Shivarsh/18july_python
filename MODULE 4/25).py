# Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

'''A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides. So, we can create a class called Triangle which inherits from Polygon . This makes all the attributes of Polygon class available to the Triangle class. We don't need to define them again'''

'''
Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.'''

'''
A Constructor is a special kind of method that have same name as the class in python self variable do the same. It can be used to set the values of the members of an object'''
